You've heard about Blazor, and you're excited to start using it. The problem is your current applications are built with existing ASP.NET Core web technologies like MVC, Razor Pages, React, and Angular, and you can't justify rewriting your web apps just to use Blazor. With .NET 6, it's now easier than ever to start building Razor components and integrate Blazor into your existing ASP.NET Core web apps. In this talk, we'll take a look at creating a reusable Razor component, how to integrate that component using Blazor into your existing MVC or Razor Pages ASP.NET Core web app, and how to integrate that component into an existing ASP.NET Core-backed React or Angular web app using the new .NET 6 ability to render Razor components from JavaScript. We'll also take a look at an experimental feature to generate React and Angular components from a Razor component and an experimental feature to generate custom HTML elements from a Razor component.
